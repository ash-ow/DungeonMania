# Assumptions
-------
## Bomb
- Bomb will explode all adjacent non-player entities 
- They are armed when they are placed, becoming unpassable

## Keys and Doors
- In our implementation, you can hold multiple keys at once
- The inventory automatically sorts through all the keys in inventory to find the correct one for the door in the player position
- thus there is no need to implement dropping/re-collecting functionality, which is simpler and enhances user experience
